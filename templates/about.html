                <p>The Nigerian Government has committed $1.2 billion USD to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In an effort to regulate and most effectively use this funding, the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals (OSSAP-MDGs) created the Conditional Grants Scheme (CGS). Through this scheme, matching grants are given to Local Government Areas (LGAs) be used for specific, approved purposes geared towards reducing poverty and improving education and public health.</p>
                <p>In order to support the CGS, and as part of their goal to promote the use of data in the local planning process, OSSAP-MDGs undertook a rigorous, geo-referenced baseline facility inventory across Nigeria spanning from 2009 to 2011 with an additional survey effort to increase coverage in 2014, called the Core Indicator survey. The aim of this survey effort was to collect geo-referenced facility-level data for all of the nation’s health, education and water facilities. This data can inform local, state, and federal interventions towards closing gaps and improving indicators targeted at achieving the MDGs.</p>
                <p>The end result is this online portal, the Nigeria MDG Information System (NMIS), a comprehensive and detailed facilities inventory that houses all of the data collected.</p>

            <div id="vision" class="panel_content">
                <p>NMIS has proven to be an invaluable planning tool for local governments areas. In 2014, OSSAP decided to take this initiative further and open the data to the general public. The hope is to encourage and help other organizations better plan future infrastructure and move Nigeria closer to achieving the MDGs. It is designed to be used by planners, researchers and the broader global development community.</p>
                <p>However, the world is not static. This website needs continued contributions from stakeholders to maintain a high level of accuracy and thoroughness. This website therefore asks for the global community to participate in keeping this key national asset up to date with the latest health, education and water facility information.</p>

                <p>The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – such as halving extreme poverty, halting the spread of HIV/AIDS, and providing universal primary education, all by the target date of 2015 – form a blueprint utilized globally by governments and leading development institutions. They have led to unprecedented efforts to meet the needs of the world’s poorest. (source: <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/</a>)</p>
                <p>The information on NMIS is intended to be used to better plan future infrastructure investments and obtain federal funding to accomplish the MDGs, particularly the Health, Education and Poverty MDGs.</p>

                Data Gathering &amp; Analysis
            </a>
            <div id="data" class="panel_content">
                <p>Gathering data for NMIS was an iterative process, involving multiple surveys and rounds of data collection; Three survey rounds made up the baseline effort completed in 2012 and a final effort, the Core Indicator survey, was completed in the first half of 2014. It was employed to “mop-up” the facilities not already surveyed, either missed or newly built.</p>
                <p>Trained enumerators collected data using Android-based smartphones to improve accuracy of geo-referencing and expedite data entry. Before each survey round, experts at both OSSAP and the Earth Institute collaboratively developed survey tools and ensured that the surveying period was a learning process used to improve the methodology for subsequent surveys. Data cleaning and analysis followed data collection, before the data was integrated into the NMIS platform.</p>
                <p>Data analysis and surveying efforts were focused on improving data use in planning in Nigeria. Our teams endeavored to create bridges between the data and planners, through the creation of tools targeted towards specific indicators relevant to the Millennium Development Goals targeted by OSSAP-MDGs office for the CGS-LGA track. Towards this end, NMIS highlights specific indicators for each facility listed, which can be used to inform decisions about how to bridge gaps to achieve goals on a number of levels, local to federal.</p>
                <p>In addition, a gap analysis was conducted for each LGA to further represent targets and shortfalls. These gap sheets are used to inform recommendations for specific interventions towards achieving the MDGs. They are adaptable and updatable, and are available on the download page.</p>

                <p>NMIS provides a snapshot of LGAs’ status on key education and health indicators, as framed by the 2015 MDGs and targets. The education and health indicators presented are not inclusive of all categories that could be represented and, thus, do not fully highlight all needs and all gaps in the basic education and public health sector in Nigeria. Water and sanitation structures were not surveyed separately and were included only if located within education and health facilities.</p>
                <p>Education and health indicators in NMIS, as well as tools and technical materials available in the About Page, do not dictate the focus of policy, planning, and implementation; rather, they help to identify gaps in order to inform and improve efforts in healthcare and education. Data from a wide variety of sources, including but not limited to NMIS, is necessary to create contextual understanding of the issues. </p>
                <p>Education and health indicators were structured with a measure of difference amongst four different OSSAP-MDGs’ facility-based surveys, which were implemented across a period of five years. OSSAP-MDGs’ facility-based surveys did not capture every education and health facility in Nigeria; for example, many private health facilities were not included in NMIS. While the aim was to be comprehensive throughout all 774 LGAs, full coverage of all health and education facilities in the country was not achieved, and some facilities are not reflected in the data. Data collection was undertaken by enumerators who were trained but not managed by The Earth Institute. Some data points may be outdated or may have been recorded inaccurately; NMIS is a dynamic database and future updates to the data will help to improve its accuracy.  </p>
                <p>Please see the Planning Resources page for information on indicators, definitions, and surveys.</p>

                <h2>Education Specific Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>The objective of the survey was to get as close to the accurate number of currently existing schools. GPS information of school buildings was a key data in this regard. These buildings may include both primary and junior secondary schools. Therefore we have tried to adjust for the same school building having multiple levels. However, we have not been able to get a disaggregate level of information by each level (in terms of the number of teachers, classrooms, etc.), which may be a disadvantage to the data collected. Hence the data is useful for understanding the number of schools in the LGA to get a sense of the infrastructure needs, but it may not be able to match exactly with each facility and inputs (furniture, teacher, classrooms, etc.).</p>

                <p>The primary purpose of this site is to provide improved information for policymakers and development planners, and as such was designed to reflect the needs of those audiences. The data reflected in the site, alongside other data collected but not presented, can be found in raw form on the download data page. </p>
                <p>The process of data gathering was managed by the MDGs office, with the technical support of the Earth Institute. The government employed nearly 1,000 enumerators periodically over the course of three years to gather the data, conducting dozens of training sessions and added back checking verification in the final mop-up phase. As with any effort to gather such a broad swath of data, it is not expected to be fully accurate, both because Nigeria’s health and education facilities are dynamic and de-centralized with a particular focus on improvement during this last year of the MDGs push, and also because the large number of enumerators mean there is some inevitable inconsistency in technique and rigor. For policy-making purposes, this is an acceptable margin of error and can be verified as required, but for research purposes is something writers must take into account.</p>
                <p>Given the extensive data gathering process, however, there may be information researchers and other experts might find useful for related purposes.  </p>
                <p>With this in mind, please find copies of the three major survey instruments used to gather the data used in this site (click to link to them). The surveys were designed initially by the Earth Institute’s Data team, based on questions designed to create MDG-related indicators used in the Millennium Villages site. The first pilot surveys were conducted in five sites across one LGA in each of Nigeria’s major geopolitical zones. Based on this information, this survey instrument was used (link) to complete the first phase of 108 Local Governments targeted by the Nigerian Government in 2011. Based on the positive response of the first 113 LGAs in the program, the Nigerian Government decided to complete the remaining 661 LGAs in 2012. In preparation for this major increase in scale, Earth Institute revised the survey document to reduce the number of questions, based both on the accuracy of responses and the actual use of the question of the original 113 LGAs. That survey document is found here (link).  These first two phases captured approximately 2/3 of the known facilities, with a final “mop-up” conducted nationwide to capture the remaining health and education facilities. This third survey instrument was employed in the mop-up phase, and expected in the annual revisions.  It is notably shorter (link), and designed primarily to ensure the broadest possible coverage of facilities, rather than to capture extensive detail about each one. </p>
